                    <h2>ABOUT THE GUARDS</h2>
                    <p>A few months after the disbanding of the Mosputer Guards due to several iconic reasons, a new Guards Division was formed. The Union Guards were created on <strong>22nd January, 2024</strong>, by <strong>Officer HENRYGEFT</strong> with the approval of <strong>Field Marshal Trevor</strong>. At the start, times were extremely rough for the Union Guards; they received constant hate and dislike from the community due to them being descendants of the Mosputer Guards. However, after a ton of hard work and help of his fellow subordinates, <strong>HENRYGEFT</strong> managed to turn a once hated division into one of the most respected, efficient, and useful divisions of The Computer Union, his legacy still being remembered, living on in the division.</p>
                    <p>The Union Guards is a division that values discipline in their tasks while also having fun during events and patrols. Union Guards are occasionally summoned to exclusive government hosted events that other divisions are barred from attending. The Union Guards expect their members to be patient, mature, yet humorous. The Union Guards' community claim themselves to be unlike any other; friendly, lively, amusing, and thrilling.</p>
                    <p><strong>Union Guards are expected to follow an Oath of Silence while actively carrying out the task of protecting VIPs, important events, and government installations. A First Lieutenant+ may also enact Oath of Silence. In every single other case, they are able to speak freely.</strong></p>
