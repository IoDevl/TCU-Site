                    <h2>ABOUT THE AIRFORCE</h2>
                    <p><strong>Union's Airforce members spawn opposing the Bulldog Brigade by the runway</strong>. They are the only members of the TCU with complete, unrestricted access to the airbase and may also enter the City and the Border.</p>
                    <p>Traditionally, Airforce members will fulfill their duties through planes and have roughly the same power as a Border Guard on foot; as such, they are only granted the bare necessities for their on-foot duties.</p>
                    <p>The <strong>Airforce is the current smallest TGRA division</strong> and is considered the hardest division to get into, as they have a low acceptance rate during tryouts, and ATC applications are considered incredibly difficult.</p>
                    <p>During the early existence of the Union's Airforce, it was known to be one of the most elite divisions next to Spedsnaz in TGRA. <strong>The name of the airbase is Airbase Injected</strong>, named after the former 1IC Injected (Dlmoroc).</p>
