                    <h2>ABOUT THE BRIGADE</h2>
                    <p>The Pot Brigade was founded by <strong>Trevor</strong>, a now retired field marshal, along with his three heads of branches: <strong>Swezzo</strong> (Head of Engineers), <strong>Demarcus</strong> (Head of Juggernauts), and <strong>Zeni</strong> (Head of Recons). The current Head of Brigade is <strong>Boufallionatlas</strong>, also a General in The Glorious Robot Army. The current Second in Command is <strong>History_ManGuyMan</strong>.</p>
                    <p>The Pot Brigade is split up into three different branches: Juggernauts, Recons, and Engineers. Upon joining the Brigade, a member is either a Recon or a Juggernaut, depending on which tryout they passed. Each Branch has unique qualities that make them different from each other.</p>
                    <p>Pot Brigade has its own camp located past the City of Noobingrad Border, just left off the Main Highway leading towards the city. Behind the 'WELCOME' sign of Noobingrad, there is a path of pebbles and gravel leading to the base, which is usually guarded by the Pot Brigade. The borders of the camp are defined by the river, which runs parallel to the highway, and barbed wire fences, surrounding the camp and fortifying the city of Noobingrad.</p>
                    <p>The spawn is a large parking lot, with a statue of the Pot Brigade's founder and Former TGRA Field Marshal, Trevor, in front of the river. To the left, there is a large warehouse, containing crates, bottles of drink, and most notably a car spawner. On the right, you can find the main base, which is a two-story grey brick building. This building is the spawn of the Pot Brigade, and inside it contains a kitchen, a classroom, and an office for the Head of the Brigade. There are also many ammo trucks scattered around.</p>
