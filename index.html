                    <p class="era-desc">The Computer Union was born from the flames of the Tsardom of Trollsa. The imperial government was thought to be greedy and corrupt. Families were starving, workers went unhappy, and children shivered in the cold, harsh winters. It was a country with no future, led by a leader with no compassion for his people, mercilessly striking down any who dared to take a stand against him.</p>
                    <p class="era-desc">However, this regime was not destined to last. The people had had enough, and they raised their union's flag in a triumphant revolt under the lead of the first dictator, <strong>Nooblord</strong>. With the help of <strong>Dary</strong> and others, the sparks of revolt had soon turned into a blazing inferno, destined to end this era of oppression. The revolution turned violent, clashes and battles were fought, and soon the imperialist trolls were defeated. The Tsarina and Tsar were not too long after found dead in their home, and their regime quickly fell. Afterwards, the dictator Nooblord would form the Revolutionary Computer Union in 1945 as an independent communist country.</p>

                    <p class="era-desc">During the early stages of the Computer Union, a war known as the Tosev Wars was still ongoing after a nation named "The Frostart Federation" declared war on TRCU in order to enslave its people. Dary was positioned as the first field marshal of the new Robot Army. However, most of the military was disorganized at the time. Due to Dary's incompetence, dictator Nooblord soon got rid of Dary and hired a new field marshal named Georg Josef Bosekhov, or "Bose." Due to Bose's great knowledge of leading military during battles, he vanquished the many enemies of TRCU. During the Tosev wars, the Computer Union forged a temporary defensive pact with Millz90 and Pinggus Khan's <strong>Ping Dynasty</strong>. Bose also made new reforms that fixed the disorganization of the military. Making a more centralized system for the army ranks.</p>

                            <p>The Computer Union is now a heavily industrialized nation. The borders of the Union are closed off, and only people can get in and out through checkpoints located throughout the fenced borders. The most notable checkpoint is in the game Papers Pls. The Computer Union was led by Nooblord until his death on 10/20/1952. Most key figures from the revolution are still present within the nation's government. The nation is currently engaged in a Cold War with the United Republic of Man, with it being the main opposition to the Union and the first most powerful ruling superpower over Earth and its people.</p>
