                    <p class="era-desc">The Computer Union was born from the flames of the Tsardom of Trollsa. The imperial government was thought to be greedy and corrupt. Families were starving, workers went unhappy, and children shivered in the cold, harsh winters. It was a country with no future, led by a leader with no compassion for his people, mercilessly striking down any who dared to take a stand against him.</p>
                    <p class="era-desc">However, this regime was not destined to last. The people had had enough, and they raised their union's flag in a triumphant revolt under the lead of the first dictator, <strong>Nooblord</strong>. With the help of <strong>Dary</strong> and others, the sparks of revolt had soon turned into a blazing inferno, destined to end this era of oppression. The revolution turned violent, clashes and battles were fought, and soon the imperialist trolls were defeated. The Tsarina and Tsar were not too long after found dead in their home, and their regime quickly fell. Afterwards, the dictator Nooblord would form the Revolutionary Computer Union in 1945 as an independent communist country.</p>

                    <h3 class="era-title">THE EARLY STAGES</h3>
                    <p class="era-desc">During the early stages of the Computer Union, a war known as the Tosev Wars was still ongoing after a nation named "The Frostart Federation" declared war on TRCU in order to enslave its people. Dary was positioned as the first field marshal of the new Robot Army. However, most of the military was disorganized at the time. Due to Dary's incompetence, dictator Nooblord soon got rid of Dary and hired a new field marshal named Georg Josef Bosekhov, or "Bose." Due to Bose's great knowledge of leading military during battles, he vanquished the many enemies of TRCU. During the Tosev wars, the Computer Union forged a temporary defensive pact with Millz90 and Pinggus Khan's <strong>Ping Dynasty</strong>. Bose also made new reforms that fixed the disorganization of the military. Making a more centralized system for the army ranks.</p>

                            <p>The Computer Union is now a heavily industrialized nation. The borders of the Union are closed off, and only people can get in and out through checkpoints located throughout the fenced borders. The most notable checkpoint is in the game Papers Pls. The Computer Union was led by Nooblord until his death on 10/20/1952. Most key figures from the revolution are still present within the nation's government. The nation is currently engaged in a Cold War with the United Republic of Man, with it being the main opposition to the Union and the first most powerful ruling superpower over Earth and its people.</p>

He vowed to do what Nooblord could not and to fix the game. He also expressed plans to eradicate all traces of Max Verstappen. Some have compared him to Khrushchev.</p>

                            <p>Shortly after TCU was sold to <strong>xCrypticPsychp</strong> by Sevsh1 for 35k USD and 3 Million Robux, the TCU main Discord had been nuked along with the Union Guard's group. Interestingly enough, the Union Guards group stayed up after the initial nuke, implying that it has been disbanded or manually removed by the new owner. Most ministries and divisions as of currently appear to not be operating under TCU rule, as suggested by still being owned by the ComputerMotherland account and not the psycho, as well as the corporate member not being in those servers. The state of some divisions and ministries is currently completely unknown. The Glorious Robot Army also will be transferred over with a new look.</p>

                            <p>Papers pls is the most popular game made by the Computer Union. The game's goal for most people is to enter the country through a border; for the nation's military forces, it's to protect the border and keep anyone from easily entering the nation. Civilians can pass the border by going through the town's border checkpoint. The civilians must have a legal passport and a permit. The inspector will then run (by protocol) things such as interrogations, checking how real they are, why they want to enter, and for how long, alongside others, often making it nearly impossible to legally enter TRCU, either as a citizen or not.</p>

                    <p class="era-desc">The Computer Union is a communist nation led by its dictator, Sevhs1. Resources are "equally" distributed—though in practice, this is often not the case.

The media is controlled by the Ministry of Media, which claims to present accurate information, though its officials are reportedly under constant threat from the CGB.</p>

                            <p>The Military of the Computer Union is known as The Glorious Robot Army. It consists of six non-officer ranks, two officer ranks and one HICOM rank. To become a soldier, one must join the Robot Army group and attend trainings to gain ranks. To become an officer, candidates must apply through <strong>MALEM</strong>, which opens up every few months.</p>

A mountainous and snowy area in the VERY northeast of the country where the Scooberian Bootcamp is located. Otherwise, the region separate from the Scooberian Region is made of flatlands and forest areas. In the winter it gets very snowy and cold, and in the summer the weather gets pretty... gray, but still cold and lifeless.</p>
